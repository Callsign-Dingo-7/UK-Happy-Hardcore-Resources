# UK Happy Hardcore Preset Packs

Here is a list of UK Happy Hardcore preset packs for those looking to reverse engineer certain artist sounds. 

Don't be afraid to experiment with taking sounds from other genres! 

Consider using sounds from Trance, Acid Techno/House, Industrial Midtempo, Russian Hardbass, Drum N Bass, Kawaii Future Bass, Eurobeat, Old Skool, European New Beat, etc.

If it sounds good, it sounds good :D

# My Gain Staging

I think that these are good to set in mono and do very light mixing in mono (for the sake of arrangement). This is more of a starting point than a strict rule I follow, because it doesn't take into account the dynamic range or loudness of the samples used or the sounds present in the mix.

This tends to get a -3/-6db peak, though you can reduce all these values by 3db to get even more headroom

## Clarification

The instruments/tracks designated as #/# db can vary in intervals of 3 db so you can have it anywhere in between.

Ex) Ride = -24/-33db

This means that the sound can be -24,-27,-30,-33 depending on what your ears think are comfortable in the mix.

The same applies for the rest of the sounds.

As for the busses, if you're confused about how I route my sounds, refer to [this video](https://youtu.be/QjcTRXge3vE) that I made regarding my FL Studio 20 DAW project template.
